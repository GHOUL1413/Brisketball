# Brisketball
Funny farm/cow themed parody of Rocket League. Functional AI players, no multiplayer, barebones prototype.

Launch Brisketball.exe to play the game. Use WASD to move, hold space to use your hay metre to boost. Charge your metre by collecting respawning hay bales. A cowbell spawns in the middle, collect it and press F to summon magic cows to help you. Try and push the wooden ball into the red goal to score.

As this was a totally unnecessary game prototype for a game design university unit, many features were not added or considered, and many bugs were not fixed, for example there is no end game. The cows work really well for 3 days work, but still have many issues. The lack of multiplayer is also obviously missing, it was just way out of scope for something that was not required in the first place. Still had a ball making it, and was my first 'completed' project.
